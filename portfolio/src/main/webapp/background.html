      <p>Hello all! I'm Jerry Li, and I'm a sophomore at UC Berkeley studying CS
          and Business Administration. I was born in Irvine, California. However,
          when I was about two months old my family moved to Beijing, and I spent
          the next 12 years growing up there. In middle school, I moved back to 
          Irvine to continue school. I really enjoyed getting to experience both
          cultures first-hand as I believe I have gained perspective from this
          transition. 
      </p>

      <p>In the past, I've interned for both tech roles and finance roles, and I am
          currently trying to figure out a solid career path to me to truly enjoy
          what I do daily. In working for a startup called Obviously AI as an AI 
          mining intern, I felt immense gratification seeing the python scripts be 
          used to guage the performance of the company. And as a consultant for
          Alipay, it was eye-opening to see the immediate effects of planning a
          successful promotional event. In this STEP internship I hope to immerse
          myself in the tech space and see what being a full-time SWE would entail.
