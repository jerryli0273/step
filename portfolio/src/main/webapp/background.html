              <p>I was born in Irvine, California. However, when I was about 
                  two months old my family moved to Beijing, and I spent
                  the next 12 years growing up there. In middle school, I moved back to 
                  Irvine to continue school. I really enjoyed getting to experience both
                  cultures first-hand as I believe I have gained perspective from this
                  transition.

              <p>In the past, I've interned for both tech roles and finance roles, and I am
                  currently trying to figure out a solid career path to me to truly enjoy
                  what I do daily. In working for a startup called Obviously AI as an AI 
                  mining intern, I felt immense gratification seeing the python scripts be 
                  used to guage the performance of the company. And as a consultant for
                  Alipay, it was eye-opening to see the immediate effects of planning a
                  successful promotional event. In this STEP internship I hope to immerse
                  myself in the tech space and see what being a full-time SWE would entail.
