      <p>One thing that I enjoy to do the most is golfing in my free time. Growing
          up, my father was an avid golfer, and he would bring me to the range to 
          practice once in a while. However, joining the golf team in high school 
          was when I really started to love golf. During times when I am stressed
          or tense, I'd be able to walk onto the golf course to relax and find some
          serenity. Even in college, I would go to the course once in a while with 
          friends to mess around. And even in quarantine, I would go to my friend's
          house to play golf on his golf simulator.
          </p>

      <p>Another thing that I spend a lot of time doing is watching YouTube. It is
          scary to me how good the recommendation algorithm is on YouTube because
          I cannot seem to resist the content presented to me. I don't have a very
          particular type of videos that I watch, but if you look through my watch
          history, there will be fishing videos, political commentary videos, and 
          even some episodes of Family Guy. It was quite funny to me that I was 
          originally supposed to work on a load test for YouTube over the summer. 
          My rationale was: if I already spend this much time on it, I might as well
          contribute to it myself.
