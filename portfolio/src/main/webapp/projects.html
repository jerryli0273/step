              <p>The very first project that I worked on was a research project in high 
                  school with Professor Kaplinghat at UCI. With a team of 4, I analyzed data
                  from the SPARC galaxy database to compare the expected values of rotational 
                  velocity of stars versus their actual velocities. The discrepancy between
                  the two values originated from the existence of dark matter. Using all the 
                  data that we could get from the database, I modeled the distribution of dark
                  matter in various galaxies.

              <p>Later at Berkeley, I found the opportunity to experiment with hardware as well
                  as software. The premise of the project is that there are "motes" which can
                  detect fire through their temperature and humidity sensors located in areas
                  prone to wild fires. Two other undergrads and I wrote the code to extract the 
                  coordinates of a potential fire, then using those coordinates, we sent a request
                  to a satellite company to take satellite pictures of the area in question.
