      <h3>Projects</h3>
      <p>The very first project that I worked on was a research project in high 
          school with Professor Kaplinghat at UCI. With a team of 4, I analyzed data
          from the SPARC galaxy database to compare the expected values of rotational 
          velocity of stars versus their actual velocities. The discrepancy between
          the two values originated from the existence of dark matter. Using all the 
          data that we could get from the database, I modeled the distribution of dark
          matter in various galaxies.
